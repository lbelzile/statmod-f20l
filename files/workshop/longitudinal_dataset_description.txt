Description:

The Six Cities Study of Air Pollution and Health was a
longitudinal study designed to characterize lung growth as 
measured by changes in pulmonary function in children and 
adolescents, and the factors that influence lung function growth. 
A cohort of 13,379 children born on or after 1967 was enrolled 
in six communities across the U.S.: Watertown (Massachusetts), 
Kingston and Harriman (Tennessee), a section of St. Louis (Missouri), 
Steubenville (Ohio), Portage (Wisconsin), and Topeka (Kansas). 
Most children were enrolled in the first or second 
grade (between the ages of six and seven) and measurements of study
participants were obtained annually until graduation from high
school or loss to follow-up. At each annual examination,
spirometry, the measurement of pulmonary function, was performed
and a respiratory health questionnaire was completed by a parent
or guardian.

The dataset contains a subset of the pulmonary function data collected 
in the Six Cities Study. The data consist of all measurements of FEV1, 
height and age obtained from a randomly selected subset of the female
participants living in Topeka, Kansas. The random sample consists
of 300 girls, with a minimum of one and a maximum of twelve
observations over time. 


Variable List: 

Subject ID, Height, Age, Initial Height, Initial Age, Log(FEV1).

Tolerance of teenagers towards delinquency

The data come from the American National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, which started in 1997. This longitudinal study follows a 
sample of young Americans born between 1980 and 1984. A total of 
8984 participants aged 12 to 17 were interviewed for the first time
 in 1997 and the cohort has been followed up 15 times till now.

We consider 16 individuals who responded to the first five interview 
waves between age 11 to 15 years old, with annual follow-up. Of 
particular interest are questions related to attitude towards 
delinquency. Teens were asked to indicate their attitude towards
 (a) cheating on an exam (b) purposely destroying someone’s goods 
(c) smoking marijuana (d) stealing an object worth less than five 
dollars (e) hitting or threatening someone without reason (f) drug
 consumption (g) break in a building or a vehicle to steal (h) sell
 hard drugs and (i) steal items worth more than $50. 
Each score was recorded on a Likert scale of four ranging 
from very bad (1) to completely acceptable (4). 

Variables:
• id : integer for identification of the participant.
• age : age of the participant at follow-up.
• tolerance : average score for the nine questions on tolerance towards delinquency.
• sex : binary indicator, unity for men and zero for women.
• exposure : average score of participant at age 11 to delinquent behaviour among
 acquaintances, an estimate of the participation of friend(s) in each activity (a) to (i).

Description:

The data are from a study of weight gain, where investigators randomly assigned
30 rats to three treatment groups: treatment 1 was a control (no additive); 
treatments 2 and 3 consisted of two different additives (thiouracil and thyroxin
respectively) to the rats drinking water. Weight was measured at
baseline (week 0) and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Note: Due to an accident at the beginning of the study, data on 3 rats from the
thyroxin group are unavailable.

Variable List:

ID, Treatment (1=Control, 2=Thiouracil, 3=Thyroxin), 
Baseline Weight (Week 0), Weight at Week 1, Weight at Week 2, 
Weight at Week 3, Weight at Week 4.

Description: 

The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) trial was a placebo-controlled, 
randomized study of succimer (a chelating agent) in children with blood 
lead levels of 20-44 micrograms/dL.
These data consist of four repeated measurements of blood lead 
levels obtained at baseline (or week 0), week 1, week 4, and 
week 6 on 100 children who were randomly assigned to chelation treatment 
with succimer or placebo.


Variable List: 

Each row of the data set contains the following 6 variables:

ID, Treatment Group, Lead Level Week 0, Lead Level Week 1, 
Lead Level Week 4, Lead Level Week 6.

Description:
Longitudinal data from a clinical trial of an interactive, multimedia program
 known as "Beat the Blues" designed to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy
 to depressed patients via a computer terminal. Patients with depression 
recruited in primary care were randomised to either the Beating the Blues
 program, or to "Treatment as Usual (TAU)".

Change in an orthodontic measurement over time for several young subjects.

• distance : a numeric vector of distances from the pituitary to the 
  pterygomaxillary fissure (mm). These distances are measured on x-ray
  images of the skull.

age: ages of the subject (yr).
gender: gender of subject, either male/female

Details
Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School followed the 
growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) from age 8 until age 14. Every 
two years they measured the distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary
 fissure, two points that are easily identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.
